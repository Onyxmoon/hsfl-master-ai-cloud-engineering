## Prototypical architecture

![Architecture](README.assets/CE_Architecture_Prototype.svg)

## Requirements
### Development


## Setup the project
### Development setup via docker-compose
> The development setup exposes all ports to the host machine, so you can access each service individually. Docker will build local and database is not persistent in this setup.
1. Clone repository from Github `git clone https://github.com/Onyxmoon/hsfl-master-ai-cloud-engineering.git`
2. Set your own username and password for the database access in compose file (replace `db-username` and `db-pw-changeMe!`). 
   > Some special characters are not possible because RQLite uses basic auth.
3. Setup .env files for the following services or add the corresponding environment variables via compose file
   - [Product Service](src/product-service)
   - [Shopping list Service](src/shoppinglist-service)
   - [User Service](src/user-service)
4. Generate a secret private key for JWT token generation for the user service.

   Specify the path to an ecdsa private key or provide the content of one directly in environment variable `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` at user service.

   You can generate a key with the following command:
   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f ./src/user-service/privateKey.pem -m pem
   ```
   > When step is missing, container will use a random but secure generated key on each start.
5. Run `docker compose up -f docker-compose.dev.yml -d` to start the containers defined in the Compose file
6. Run `docker compopse down` to stop container, networks, volumes, and images created by up.
### Normal setup via docker-compose
> The normal setup isolates the internal communication between services and only the proxy is reachable from the host machine. Prebuild images from Docker Hub will be used and database is persistent in this setup.
1. Use the docker-compose.yml from the root of this repository.
2. It is recommended to set your own username and password for the database access in compose file (replace `db-username` and `db-pw-changeMe!`).
   > Some special characters are not possible because RQLite uses basic auth.
3. Generate a secret private key for JWT token generation for the user service. 
  
   Specify the path to an ecdsa private key or provide the content of one directly in environment variable `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` at user service.
   
   You can generate a key with the following command:
   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f privateKey.pem -m pem
   ```
   > When step is missing, container will use a random but secure generated key on each start.
4. Run `docker compose up -f docker-compose.yml -d` to start the containers defined in the Compose file
5. Run `docker compopse down` to stop container, networks, volumes, and images created by up.

### Setup with kubernetes
1. SECRETS
1. Apply the manifests in `kubernetes/manifests`
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -R -f ./kubernetes/manifests
   ```
